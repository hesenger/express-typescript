# Express + Typescript

Initial setup for an Express server using Typescript with auto reload and tests.

## Commands

- `yarn dev` - Start the server in development mode
- `yarn build` - Build production files into `dist` folder
- `yarn start` - Start the server in production mode

## Tests

I'm a test addicted, they help me through out the development and I definitely not
write them at the end for that reason.

This repo reflects my passion and applies some of the practices I consider very
important for a good developer experience when writing code to a repo. You will
notice that the timeout for tests is set to 500ms, how many times you joined a team
and realized that just to run the current test you are writing the codebase takes
3min ðŸ¤¯?

I hate this bad developer experience and I'm sure that slowdown the dev cycle more than
problems which developers are way more noise. Give it a shot, and see how pleaseant is 
the experience of work with intant tests that guide the current function implementation
you are working on ðŸ¤©.
